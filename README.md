Web-Speech-API-demos
====================

**Project Overview**
* Using one of the HTML based presentation frameworks, use the Web Speech API to add voice commands to go from slide to slide.

**Goals**
* Research the state of the Web Speech API both the speech recognition and speech synthesis and see how well supported they are in desktop and mobile browsers.
* Build an example of Web Speech API, with modular enough code base to be used in future Secret Location projects.
* Learn about the limitations of the Web Speech API on the desktop and mobile
Write a post about what was discovered for others at Secret Location.

**What is Innovative**
* The Web Speech API is brand new. Beyond demos and a Google Chrome experiment project, I’m unaware of it being used in any public projects.
* A support for this new API grows there’s potential to use this in interesting ways.
